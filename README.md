Considering the arrival time and burst time requirement of the process the scheduler schedules the processed by interrupting the processor after every 6 units of time and does consider the completion of the process in the iteration. The scheduler than checks for the number of processor every 10 unit of time and considers the completion of the processed in the iteration. the scheduler check the number of processes waiting in the queue for the processor after the second iteration and gives the processor to the process which needs more time to complete than the other processes to go in the terminated state. The inputs for the number of reqirements, arrical time and burst time should be provided by the user. Consider the bollowing units for refrence.
